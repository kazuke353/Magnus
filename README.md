## Project Description

**Personal Portfolio Dashboard** is a web application designed to empower you with intelligent insights and control over your investment portfolio. Built with Remix, Tailwind CSS, and powered by AI, this app goes beyond simple portfolio tracking. It provides a comprehensive view of your investments, automated allocation strategies, insightful analysis, and forward-looking projections, all in one user-friendly dashboard.

**Key Features:**

*   **Portfolio Performance at a Glance:**  Quickly see your overall portfolio performance, total invested value, returns, and key summary metrics on a dynamic dashboard.
*   **Grouped Holdings with Intelligent Allocation:**  Organize your investments into custom groups (e.g., "Next-Gen Growth," "REIT," "Defensive Growth"). Define target allocations for each group and let the app intelligently distribute your budget and guide your investment decisions.
*   **Automated Budgeting & Scheduling:**  Set up recurring monthly contributions to your portfolio and easily adjust your budget for specific months. Plan your investment schedule and stay on track with your financial goals.
*   **Trading 212 Pie Integration (Future):**  Planned support for seamless integration with Trading 212 "Pies," including transaction history import via CSV and potentially API for enhanced data synchronization.
*   **Forward-Looking Portfolio Projections:**  Get estimated projections of your portfolio's potential performance over 1, 5, and 10-year horizons, helping you visualize long-term growth scenarios.
*   **AI-Powered Portfolio Analysis:**  Leverage the power of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) like Qwen 2.5, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek to gain in-depth analysis of your portfolio.  Benefit from a consensus analysis generated by a final summarizing LLM, providing unique insights and perspectives on your investments.
*   **Interactive Charts and Visualizations:**  Explore your portfolio allocation, performance, and other key metrics through interactive and informative charts, making it easy to understand complex financial data.
*   **Task Management:**  Utilize a built-in task management system to schedule and manage investment-related tasks and reminders.
*   **Settings Page:**  Customize your app experience with settings for currency, budget, and other preferences.
*   **Secure User Authentication:**  Built with Remix's robust framework, ensuring secure user accounts and data protection.

## Development

To get started with development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```shellscript
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-project-directory]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```shellscript
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment variables:**

    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
    *   **(List any required environment variables here, e.g., API keys, database connection strings, etc.  Provide example or placeholder values if appropriate.)**

    ```env
    # Example .env (replace with your actual values)
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string_here"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```shellscript
    npm run dev
